# Android Studio Overview:

Each project in Android Studio contains one or more modules with source code files and resource files. Types of modules include:
* Android app modules
* Library modules
* Google App Engine modules
By default, Android Studio displays your project files in the Android project view, as shown. This view is organized by modules to provide quick access to your project's key source files.

1. The toolbar lets you carry out a wide range of actions, including running your app and launching Android tools.
2. The navigation bar helps you navigate through your project and open files for editing. It provides a more compact view of the structure visible in the Project window.
3. The editor window is where you create and modify code. Depending on the current file type, the editor can change. For example, when viewing a layout file, the editor displays the Layout Editor.
4. The tool window bar runs around the outside of the IDE window and contains the buttons that allow you to expand or collapse individual tool windows.
5. The tool windows give you access to specific tasks like project management, search, version control, and more. You can expand them and collapse them.
6. The status bar displays the status of your project and the IDE itself, as well as any warnings or messages.
